# Credit Card Fraud Detection
<br><br>
The aim of this task is to:
- Build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions.
<br>
- Preprocess and normalize the transaction data, handle class imbalance issues, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.
<br>
- Train a classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random forests, to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine.
<br>
- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, and consider techniques like oversampling or undersampling for improving results
