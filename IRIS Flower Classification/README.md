# Task 2 - IRIS Flower Classification

<p>
    The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their measurements. Now, imagine that I have the measurements of Iris flowers categorized by their respective species. My objective is to train a machine learning model that can learn from these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into their respective species.
